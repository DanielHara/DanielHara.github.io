                    Hi there! I'm a frontend developer, currently living in the outskirts of Zurich, Switzerland. I'm passionate about solving interesting problems, ranging from designing delightful UX experiences
                    up to theoretical Computer Science problems. I'm a quite well-rounded person, so you'll find here posts about coding, living abroad, sports, music, traveling and learning new languages.
                </p>

                <div className="flex justify-center items-center">

                    I'm originally Brazilian, with Japanese (from my dad's side) and Spanish (from my mom's side) origins. I lived in SÃ£o Paulo for 24 years, up to my graduation
                    in Computer Engineering at ITA, which is arguably the most rigorous engineering school in Brazil. In case you're curious, here is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instituto_Tecnol%C3%B3gico_de_Aeron%C3%A1utica"> article about it</a>.
                </p>

                    My free time is spent between sport, playing the piano and watching performances of classical music and opera (I'm proud to say I've been to most of the major opera houses in the world).
                </p>

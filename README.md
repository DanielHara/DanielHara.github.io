# My personal website

Very simple website, based on next.js, React and Tailwind CSS.

For now, the only relevant page is https://www.danielhara.me/page/about

I just forked this template https://github.com/frontendweb3/blogify

# Next steps??

I want to create a real blog, about travel, music, coding, and other topics. I'm always short in time, so this is in progress.

My current plan is to turn page https://www.danielhara.me/page/album into something like a personal Pinterest. For now, there is just a infinite scroll of the same random images. I plan to make into an infinite scroll of my own pictures, which I took during my trips.
